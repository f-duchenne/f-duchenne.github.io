    "section": "",
    "text": "Recently, we have been trying to use rarefaction methods to get comparable esitmate of species richness over time. The data had very heterogeneous sampling pressure over time, so just looking at the species richness was not really an option.\nThe question came to our mind: what if abundance distribution change over time? is the method working well regardless the species abundance distribution shape?\nI struggled a bit to find the answer to my question in the first papers I was looking at. In the appendix F of (Chao et al. 2014) some simulations suggest that the outputs of the rarefaction with Hill numbers might depend on distribution of abundances but nothing shocking. I did not find anything about that in the paper describing the iNEXT R package (Hsieh, Ma, and Chao 2016). So I decided to go for a bunch of simulations.\nLet‚Äôs imagine 3 different sites, that have exactly the same number of species (n = 100) but different abundance distributions. Here I assume that the probability of detection of each species is directly proportional to abundance and thus I will directly draw detection probabilities.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nnbsp=100\n# a pool of species with a detection probability for each\nsp_pool_site1=data.frame(sp=paste0(\"sp\",1:nbsp),prob=exp(-runif(nbsp,0,10)),site=\"site1\")\nsp_pool_site2=data.frame(sp=paste0(\"sp\",1:nbsp),prob=exp(-runif(nbsp,0,4)),site=\"site2\")\nsp_pool_site3=data.frame(sp=paste0(\"sp\",1:nbsp),prob=runif(nbsp,0,1),site=\"site3\")\n\nsp_pool=rbind(sp_pool_site1,sp_pool_site2,sp_pool_site3) #put all sites together\n\npl1=ggplot(data=sp_pool,aes(x=prob))+geom_histogram(fill=\"white\",color=\"black\")+xlab(\"detection probability (abundance)\")+ylab(\"Number of species\")+\ntheme_bw()+theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\"),panel.grid.major = element_blank(),panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),panel.background = element_blank(),plot.title=element_text(size=14,face=\"bold\",hjust = 0),\nstrip.background=element_rect(fill=NA,color=NA),panel.border=element_blank(),legend.position=\"none\")+\nfacet_wrap(~site)\n\nprint(pl1)\n\n\nThen, for each of these three sites I will simulate sampling events. For each sampling event I draw the number of detections for each species in a Binomial distribution, \\(B(t,p)\\), where \\(t\\) is the number of trials (a proxy for the sampling intensity) and \\(p\\) the detection probability of the species. I simulate 10 replicates for different values of sampling intensity and number of sampling events. For each simulations I used the iNEXT R function to estimate the asymptotic richness. Below is the code of the simulations, with some dirty nested loops and rbinds.\n\n\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(iNEXT)\n# a vector of different sampling effort\nsamp_vec =c(1,3) #sampling intensity\nsamp_events=c(5,10,20) #number of sampling events\n\n# generate the records\nnbrep=10\nresf=NULL\nfor(si in unique(sp_pool$site)){ #loop over site\n    pool=subset(sp_pool,site==si)\n    for(ii in samp_vec){ #loop over sampling intensity\n        for(i in samp_events){ #loop over different number of sampling events\n            for(z in 1:i){ # generating sampling events\n                for(j in 1:nbrep){ #loop over replicates\n                    vec=c(sapply(pool$prob,function(x){rbinom(1,ii,x)}))\n                    resf=rbind(resf,data.frame(sp=rep(pool$sp,vec),samp=ii,nbsamp=i,samp_event=z,site=si,rep=j))\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nb=resf %&gt;% group_by(samp,site,rep,sp,nbsamp,samp_event) %&gt;% count(name =\"abund\") #aggregate data per species, for each site and simulation parameters\n\nb$id=paste(b$site,b$rep,b$nbsamp,b$samp,sep=\".\") #create a unique id for each simulations\n\ncomm=split(b, b$id) #creat a list fo community data, one dataframe per simulations\ncomm=lapply(comm,function(x){dcast(x,id+sp~samp_event,value.var=\"abund\",fill=0)}) #put each data frame in the right format for iNEXT function\ncomm=lapply(comm,function(x){x[,-c(1:2)]}) #remove id columns\n\nrari=iNEXT(comm,q=0,size=c(50,100,500,1000),datatype =\"incidence_raw\")\n\nOnce this is done, let‚Äôs have a look at the results.\n\nrich_out=subset(rari$AsyEst,Diversity==\"Species richness\") #extract the predicted richness\nrich_out=merge(rich_out,unique(b[,c(\"id\",\"site\",\"samp\",\"rep\",\"nbsamp\")]),by.x=\"Assemblage\",by.y=\"id\") #adding information about parameters of simulations to that\n\npl2=ggplot(data=rich_out,aes(x=as.factor(nbsamp),y=Estimator,color=as.factor(samp)))+geom_boxplot()+xlab(\"Number of sampling events\")+ylab(\"Richness estimation\")+\ntheme_bw()+theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\"),panel.grid.major = element_blank(),panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),panel.background = element_blank(),plot.title=element_text(size=14,face=\"bold\",hjust = 0),\nstrip.background=element_rect(fill=NA,color=NA),panel.border=element_blank(),legend.position=\"right\")+labs(color=\"Sampling intensity\")+\nfacet_wrap(~site)+geom_hline(aes(yintercept=nbsp))\n\npl2\n\n\nThe estimated richness depends on the abundance distribution, which is relatively fair, because the site with an exponential distribution of abundances have a significant amount of rare species, that could almost be considered as not present. More problematic, is that the predicted richness depends on sampling pressure. If for uniform distribution (site 3) the method corrected well for sampling effort, it was not the case for more uneven abundance distributions (sites 1 & 2). Abundance distributions appear to be strongly uneven in nature (Callaghan et al. 2023), so this seems to be a real issue.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCallaghan, Corey T., Lu√≠s Borda-de-√Ågua, Roel van Klink, Roberto Rozzi, and Henrique M.

    "text": "Cheating in mutualism: the good, the bad and the ugly sides\nMutualism, an interaction that benefits all species involved, is widespread in the web of life. In natural systems involving mutualism, it is common to find cheaters, species reaping benefits from interactions without providing benefits to their partners. Cheating has been described in mycorrhizal, plant‚Äìpollinator, cleaner fish-client, and seed dispersal interactions.\nCheating is often view from an evolutionary perspective, widely based on game theory, and thus considered as a way to escape the cost associated with mutualism. For example, energy expenditure due to nectar production in plants or foraging in animals, in plant-pollinator networks. In this case, while the species could interact legitimately (i.e., mutualistically), they cheat because to them the cost of cheating is lower than the cost of legitimate interactions. However, the data suggest us another story: species do not cheat to escape the cost of mutualism, but to access new resources that they would not access otherwise. These cheating have completely different consequences for the community: one is replacing mutualistic links by cheating, the other one is adding cheating without modifying the existing mutualistic links. So in the second case, species innovate by interacting with a new partner, let‚Äôs call it innovative cheating. In the second case, species just cheat on their existing partner, we will call it conservative cheating, in opposition ot the innovative one.\nIn a recent work initiated during the master thesis of S. Aubert, we used generalized Lotka‚ÄìVolterra models to show that these tw kinds of cheating have very different consequences for the persistence of the community. Conservative cheating negatively affects community persistence, while innovative cheating can enhance community persistence under some conditions: when cheaters have few mutualistic partners, cheat at low or intermediate frequency and the cost associated with mutualism is not too high. Under these conditions, the negative effects of cheating on partner persistence are overcompensated at the community level by the positive feedback loops that arise in diverse mutualistic communities.\nBut the story did not stop here, we then used an empirical dataset of plant‚Äìbird interactions (hummingbirds and flowerpiercers), and we found that observed cheating patterns were highly consistent with the theoretical cheating patterns found to increase community persistence! This result suggests that the cheating patterns observed in nature could contribute to promote species coexistence in mutualistic communities, instead of necessarily destabilizing them."

    "text": "My research is motivated by a strong pleasure to explore and understand our world, which is based on a fascination for nature [1]. I focus on understanding the mechanisms structuring and (de-)stabilising natural communities, as well as the anthropogenic perturbations affecting these species assemblages, but I am interested in a wide range of topics in Ecology and Evolution. I mainly use plant-pollinator interactions as a study model, coupled with mechanistic and theoretical approaches to investigate how the distribution of direct and indirect interspecific interactions affects species coexistence. In parallel, I use macro-ecological and empirical approaches to estimate the impact of global changes on the distribution, co-occurrence and evolutionary trajectories of species. This empirical aspect of my research focuses on the statistical analysis of past temporal dynamics to understand the consequences of global change for biodiversity, from species to communities.\n\n\n\nMy research topics are strongly interconnected in a framework that tries to disentangle how global change affect temporal dynamics of biodiversity, from species to communities\n\n\n¬†[1] ¬´ Le savant n‚Äô√©tudie pas la nature parce que cela est utile ; il l‚Äô√©tudie parce qu‚Äôil y prend plaisir et il y prend plaisir parce qu‚Äôelle est belle. ¬ª Henri Poincar√©, Science et m√©thode (1908)\n\nResearch is a collective work\nNone of my works have been conducted alone. This point is important and should be highlighted. None of my projects could have been achieved without these collaborators, who have taken time to exchange during hours and participate to these studies, and without these numerous researchers who took time to share ideas, built collaborative tools, etc. Thus, my research activities owe a lot to the collegiality and are not really my research only but the results of a collaborative work.¬†\nThe ability to have deep interactions with other researchers is possible only in a configuration in which researchers have time to do research, to explore spontaneous ideas when they come. I am one of those who think that the current international way of doing research, pushing researchers to become managers and spending time to look for fundings instead of doing research by themselves, is deleterious for science. I think it is deleterious because of two main reasons: (i) it exacerbates competition at lower levels of the pyramid, promote false collaboration relatively to deep and cross-generational interactions, (ii) it increases the permeability of academic research to private fundings and thus to private interests. Research is a common good of human societies, and I think researchers have the responsibility to fight against any attempt to that, to preserve a public research that aims to produce knowledge for human societies. Maintaining this common good requires to fight against processes that promote individual and private interests over public ones: economic system imposed by the scientific journals, leading to a waste of public money, evaluation system, that lead to run after productivity, etc. Some inspiring readings have shown that our evaluation system, based on citations and publication productivity, is unfair (Davies et al., 2021) and can easily lead to a selection of ‚Äúbad science‚Äù (Smaldino & McElreath, 20016).\nFrench research is now under great pressures to accelerate the transition to a more ‚Äúinternational and competitive‚Äù system: https://aoc.media/opinion/2021/04/26/chercher-pour-le-bien-commun/. This shift to a vertical organization of research teams will undoubtedly increase even more the pressure to produce more, regardless the quality,¬†and favours the permeability of research to conflict of interests, while future challenges for human societies require to preserve integrity of science.

    "text": "Why space-for-time substitution can be misleading?\nAssessing how global change, a temporal process, affects biodiversity by a space-for-time-substitution can be misleading because it neglects site history, local adaptation and the diffusion of perturbations over habitats and landscapes. Indeed, by neglecting what became extinct because of global change before present, space-for-time substitution approaches are based on a strongly bias sampling of biodiversity, compared to pre-global change reference. Moreover, in western countries, especially in Europe, almost every landscapes and habitats have been affected by recent anthropogenic perturbations, spatial gradients only reflect damaged habitats gradients. Using space-for-time substitution only to infer the effects of global change on biodiversity is similar to studying evolution of the life without considering paleontological records. Those records provide important information about what was present but is no longer present. Neglecting the cemetery of evolution [2] leads to misunderstanding evolution, and similarly neglecting temporal data in global changes studies leads to misestimate global change effects on biodiversity (Figure 2).\n[2] ‚ÄúBut just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.‚Äù Charles Darwin\n\nFigure 2: Time series vs space-for-time substitution to infer global change effects on biodiversity. Schematic represenation of the temporal dynamics of an historical homogeneous landscape with 7 identical plant communities under a global change scenario involving agricultural intensification (blue gradient) and urbanization (red gradient). The temporal dynamics of global change drivers are presented on the left, while their spatial gradients are presented at the bottom. The size of the circles is proportional to the community diversity. Four communities collapsed before current time, while three of them persisted. By comparing diversity along the spatial gradients at current time, no signal would be observed because the three communities have the same diversity and because we missed collapsed communities. In contrast studying the system over time would reveal a strong negative effect of agricultural intensity and urbanization on plant diversity."
