    "section": "Why space-for-time substitution can be misleading?",
    "text": "Why space-for-time substitution can be misleading?\nAssessing how global change, a temporal process, affects biodiversity by a space-for-time-substitution can be misleading because it neglects site history, local adaptation and the diffusion of perturbations over habitats and landscapes. Indeed, by neglecting what became extinct because of global change before present, space-for-time substitution approaches are based on a strongly bias sampling of biodiversity, compared to pre-global change reference. Moreover, in western countries, especially in Europe, almost every landscapes and habitats have been affected by recent anthropogenic perturbations, spatial gradients only reflect damaged habitats gradients. Using space-for-time substitution only to infer the effects of global change on biodiversity is similar to studying evolution of the life without considering paleontological records. Those records provide important information about what was present but is no longer present. Neglecting the cemetery of evolution [2] leads to misunderstanding evolution, and similarly neglecting temporal data in global changes studies leads to misestimate global change effects on biodiversity (Figure 2).\n[2] “But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and serious objection which can be urged against the theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.” Charles Darwin\n\nFigure 2: Time series vs space-for-time substitution to infer global change effects on biodiversity. Schematic represenation of the temporal dynamics of an historical homogeneous landscape with 7 identical plant communities under a global change scenario involving agricultural intensification (blue gradient) and urbanization (red gradient). The temporal dynamics of global change drivers are presented on the left, while their spatial gradients are presented at the bottom. The size of the circles is proportional to the community diversity. Four communities collapsed before current time, while three of them persisted. By comparing diversity along the spatial gradients at current time, no signal would be observed because the three communities have the same diversity and because we missed collapsed communities. In contrast studying the system over time would reveal a strong negative effect of agricultural intensity and urbanization on plant diversity."

    "section": "Cheating in mutualism: the good, the bad and the ugly sides",
    "text": "Cheating in mutualism: the good, the bad and the ugly sides\nMutualism, an interaction that benefits all species involved, is widespread in the web of life. In natural systems involving mutualism, it is common to find cheaters, species reaping benefits from interactions without providing benefits to their partners. Cheating has been described in mycorrhizal, plant–pollinator, cleaner fish-client, and seed dispersal interactions.\nCheating is often view from an evolutionary perspective, widely based on game theory, and thus considered as a way to escape the cost associated with mutualism. For example, energy expenditure due to nectar production in plants or foraging in animals, in plant-pollinator networks. In this case, while the species could interact legitimately (i.e., mutualistically), they cheat because to them the cost of cheating is lower than the cost of legitimate interactions. However, the data suggest us another story: species do not cheat to escape the cost of mutualism, but to access new resources that they would not access otherwise. These cheating have completely different consequences for the community: one is replacing mutualistic links by cheating, the other one is adding cheating without modifying the existing mutualistic links. So in the second case, species innovate by interacting with a new partner, let’s call it innovative cheating. In the second case, species just cheat on their existing partner, we will call it conservative cheating, in opposition ot the innovative one.\nIn a recent work initiated during the master thesis of S. Aubert, we used generalized Lotka–Volterra models to show that these tw kinds of cheating have very different consequences for the persistence of the community. Conservative cheating negatively affects community persistence, while innovative cheating can enhance community persistence under some conditions: when cheaters have few mutualistic partners, cheat at low or intermediate frequency and the cost associated with mutualism is not too high. Under these conditions, the negative effects of cheating on partner persistence are overcompensated at the community level by the positive feedback loops that arise in diverse mutualistic communities.\nBut the story did not stop here, we then used an empirical dataset of plant–bird interactions (hummingbirds and flowerpiercers), and we found that observed cheating patterns were highly consistent with the theoretical cheating patterns found to increase community persistence! This result suggests that the cheating patterns observed in nature could contribute to promote species coexistence in mutualistic communities, instead of necessarily destabilizing them."
