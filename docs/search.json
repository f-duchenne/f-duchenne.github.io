This point is important and should be highlighted. None of my projects could be achieved without these collaborators, who have taken time to exchange during hours and participate to these studies, and without these numerous researchers that take time to share ideas, built collaborative tools, such as R packages, etc. Thus, my research activities owe a lot to the collegiality and are not really my research but the results of a collaborative work. \nThis possibility to deeply interact with other researchers is possible only in a configuration allowing researchers to have time to do research, to explore spontaneous ideas when they come. I am one of those who think that the current international way of doing research, pushing researchers to become managers and spending time to look for fundings instead of doing research by themselves, is deleterious for science. I think it is deleterious because of two main reasons: (i) it exacerbates competition at lower levels of the pyramid, promote false collaboration relatively to deep and cross-generational interactions, (ii) it increases the permeability of academic research to private fundings and thus to private interests. Research is a common good of human societies, and I think researchers have the responsibility to fight against any attempt to that, to preserve a public research that aims to produce knowledge to human societies. Maintaining this common good, require to fight against process that promote individual and private interests over public ones: economic system imposed by the scientific journals, leading to a waste of public money, evaluation system, that lead to run after productivity, etc. Some inspiring readings have shown that our evaluation system, based on citations and publication, is unfair (Davies et al., 2021) and can easily lead to a selection of “bad science” (Smaldino & McElreath, 20016).\nFrench research is now under great pressures to accelerate the transition to a more “international and competitive” system: https://aoc.media/opinion/2021/04/26/chercher-pour-le-bien-commun/. This shift to a vertical organization of research teams will undoubtedly increase even more the pressure to produce more, regardless the quality, and favours the permeability of research to conflict of interests, while future challenges for human societies require to preserve integrity of science.
